# STATE — Troll Farm (single entry point)

Last updated: 2026-07-23. This file is live state, not a record — the ledger volumes are the
record. Hard budget: 150 lines. Rewrite it whenever facts change.

## 1. Live identity

- Player `tass`, Legend practice ladder (contest ended 2026-05-25 — no deadline).
- Resident: agent `6561795`, submission `41015603`.
- Source: `cgauto/submissions/candidate-agent6553250-preseed-orchard-coverage-slim.min.rs`
  (62,725 bytes, slim Yamo/Orchard + pre-seed + orchard coverage).
  SHA-256: `a8eb3b2bb646c59baf4c0a8b6bbdd9ca626e20ab2a27553dadbded047b884e55`
- `cgauto/api_submit.py` default = that exact source. Keep it that way.
- Last ladder read: rank 43/107 @ 21.97 (2026-07-23 ~10:47 MSK, D164 snapshot; earlier same
  day: rank 40/107 @ 22.18 with 197 battles).

## 2. Goal

Legend **rank ≤ 3** on a mature read plus a later confirmation (journal vol 1 "Completion
rule"). Rank-3 bar was 28.11 at Phase 21 — a moving reference, not a frozen target.

## 3. Standing rules

- Arena writes require explicit user authorization. No exceptions.
- Never churn submissions: fresh submissions read 3–4 points below matured ones (proven by
  failed same-code A/A on 2026-07-16). Restores/candidates burn standing.
- Sealed, do not open: maps `9,844,200–9,844,215`; the official-map holdout; the 11 sealed
  field games from the D164 snapshot.
- Substrate rule (D158/D161): every controller uses exact Yamo/Orchard resident
  fallback natively, or first proves same-panel dominance over it. D40/q6 is dead as a
  competition substrate.
- External play bursts ≤ 12 games; stop on HTTP 422 or degenerate results.
- Bulk writes: preflight `python3 cgauto/check_external_storage.py --required-free-gib <N>`
  (see `AGENTS.md` + `docs/storage-policy.md`). YT root:
  `//home/delivery_ml/research/tarstars/troll_farm`.

## 4. Open thread

- **Next experiment — D167** (per D166 decision, 2026-07-23): recover the seed-acquisition
  paths behind the 135 natural local PLANT returns and the field PLANT returns; then freeze
  trajectory-conditioned semantic successor-job value over exact resident KEEP /
  acquire-and-PLANT / current-own-crop HARVEST, evaluated with short resident-backed
  rollouts. Do not force one verb, reopen D87/D89, or train on terminal outcomes.
- Queue after D167 (reorder only from written evidence):
  1. If D167 closes: family-robust closed-loop objective on the resident substrate — the
     explicitly skipped D109 question (see vol 1, D157 audit).
  2. Standing: let the resident mature undisturbed; no arena writes without authorization.

## 5. Reading order & pointers

1. This file.
2. `docs/CONSTRAINTS.md` — check BEFORE proposing any experiment.
3. Live ledger: `data/analysis/live-agent-6553250/legend-top3-experiment-cycle-vol2-2026-07-23.md`
   (frozen history: `...-2026-07-18.md` = vol 1, 292 KB, includes Phases 1–21 + D1–D166).
4. `AGENTS.md` (process), `docs/storage-policy.md` (storage/YT), `docs/mechanics.md` (game).
5. Superseded docs: `docs/archive/INDEX.md`. Pre-2026-07-23 doc references resolve via
   `docs/archive/`.

Per-experiment obligations: ledger entry in the live volume; a `docs/CONSTRAINTS.md` bullet
for anything closed; update §4 of this file. First session ending with the live volume over
100 KB freezes it (one appended note) and opens the next.
