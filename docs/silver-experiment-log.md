# Experiment log — beat boss4 (local sim, planner vs boss4, 300 seeds x2 seats = 600 games)
Calibration: local planner-vs-boss4 ~ real CG (real 70-77% per handoff).
Game shape: SCORCHED-EARTH. Trees ~9 -> 3 (t100) -> ~1 (t150) -> 0 (t200). Decided by ~t150.
Our edge = fruit (27.8 vs 19.2). boss4 edge = tiny wood (9.1 vs 8.5).

| # | change | winrate | margin | keep? |
|---|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| base | v0.8.3 as-committed | 68.7% | +7.2 | baseline |
| B1 | banker: nearest reachable free drop cell | 73.7% | +9.2 | KEEP (in best/) |
| E1 | chopper HARVESTs fruit before felling | 57.7% | +0.2 | REVERT (denial speed >> +1 fruit) |
| B1sweep | DENIAL_W: 0=76.2 1=74.0 2=72.8 3=71.2 (@200s) | monotone: lower W = more wins, lower margin | W=1 balance |
| B2 | FRUIT_DENIAL @W1: 0=74.0 1=75.0 2=75.5 4=76.5 (@200s) | chop fruited enemy trees = deny fruit | KEEP, tune |

## LOCKED: v0.8.5 = B1(banker fix) + W=1 FB=6 (denial+fruit-denial tuning)
Confirmed @300 seeds (600 games): 76.8% win, +9.9 margin. Baseline v0.8.3 was 68.7%.
Both main.rs and planner.rs updated; main.rs compiles standalone (rustc --edition 2021).
Chose W1/FB6 over W0/FB4 (78.7%): W0 has half the margin, 2x draws, drops denial-weight
(model under-values denial since real boss4 replants). W1/FB6 = robust decisive wins.

## PIVOT (real data): SILVER, Boss4 = level2/Boss.cs 2-troll FARMER. We lost 89-222 as chopper.
Sim was mis-calibrated (sparse -> favored chopping). Real Silver is dense -> farming wins.
Ported real boss -> strategies/boss_real.rs (bossreal). Sim not perfectly predictive but
DIRECTION clear: pure harvester out-farms the 2-troll boss.
| v0.9.0 | NO_CHOP pure harvester (no chop/mine/chopper-train) | vs bossreal HIGH-dens 96%, 189 fruit, 3.3 trolls | TESTING on CG |

## REAL DATA (turn-8 @TFSUM): Boss4 trains VERSATILE POWER-TROLLS (1,2,3,3) hp3+chop3+cc2, scores ~250.
We trained weak (1,1,1,0) + HOARDED apple8/iron9 -> scored 86. Both v0.8.5(chop) & v0.9.0(harvest) lost ~86 vs ~250.
| v0.9.1 | versatile power-trolls: train strongest affordable of [(2,3,3,3),(1,2,3,3),(1,2,2,2),(1,2,2,1)]; harvest fruited/chop else/mine iron/invest | CG TEST | ? |
NOTE: v0.9.1 = NEW clean decide() in main.rs ONLY (decide_old kept). planner.rs NOT synced (still v0.9.0 harvester). Sim unreliable for Silver anyway.
| v0.9.1 | versatile harvest-primary | CG: me=111 vs boss 202 (was 86); improved! but harvest-primary => only wood1 | direction right |
## FINAL @TFSUM t=300: boss wins on WOOD 184/283 via (2,4,2,2) cc4 chopper. We only 2 trolls, wood1.
| v0.9.2 | CHOP-primary: big choppers [(2,4,2,2),(2,4,0,3),..], target nearest tree, chop (grab fruit bonus), mine iron, invest | CG TESTING | ? |

## FINAL LADDER (real CG, single noisy games; boss varies ~110-283 by map):
v0.9.3 mixed=74 | v0.9.4 mixed+resource-fix=61 (5 trolls, weak) | v0.9.5 save-for-chopper=105 vs 109 (CLOSE; hoarded, 1 iron short)
v0.9.6 iron 1-short again (2 trolls, hoard) | v0.9.7 chopper-now-CHOPS: me=115 vs 202, LED at t150 (52-35), wood 0->18.
BEST = v0.9.7 (115, produces wood+fruit, 4 trolls, competitive early). Still LOSES ~115 vs ~202.
Remaining gap: boss builds (2,4,2,2) cc4/ms2 chopper by ~t100; ours is cc3/ms1 built later -> out-wooded late.
Next: push chopper to cc4 (needs lemon16 saved) built earlier; maybe 2 choppers; don't scorch (keep >=harvesters).
NOT submitted to arena (v0.9.7 still loses to boss; would risk rank 49). Committed HEAD = v0.8.3 arena bot (safe).

## DENIAL thread (user's idea) — NEGATIVE on real CG:
v0.9.8 deny+plant = 0/6 (planting drained our training plum -> stuck at 2 trolls, hoard apple56).
  BUT debug showed denial DID delay boss chopper (stayed 1.1.1.2 until ~t100, boss 162 not 244).
v0.9.9 time-limited deny (turns<=55, no plant) = 0/6. Chopper's early trek costs us wood; boss recovers.
CONCLUSION: denial mechanism is real (delays boss) but net-negative -- reverted to v0.9.7 (best, wins some maps).
Now relying on parallel agents (faithful sim + search bot).
